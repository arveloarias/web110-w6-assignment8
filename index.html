            <p>Hi, I'm Lina! I'm an adventurous person who likes to travel, explore and discover new things. I like exploring new places and trying out new things, whether it is climbing mountains, playing sports or going on a desert adventure.</p>
            <br>

            <p>I started exploring in 2007 when I decided to take a break from all the serious stuff in my life. I wanted to go back to the basics. After a couple of months of exploring Europe on a public bus and a backpack, I caught the travel bug and decided to continue my exploration journey. I started traveling the world in 2007. I wanted to travel to countries that were still relatively unexplored in 2006, so I found some cheap routes and visited some amazing parts of the world. Now I feel like a journey has to be a constant process, where I'm always looking for new things, exploring, and having fun!</p>
            <br>

            <p>The success of my travel blog, Journeys Around The World, also resulted in me becoming a professional photographer, which eventually led to me getting a camera and going back to school to study photography. In 2014, I quit my job and traveled for a year, which resulted in me gaining some valuable travel knowledge and photography skills, which I'm now able to use to share my stories, photographs and travel adventures with you.</p>
            <br>

            <p>I currently live in Wellington, New Zealand. I have a 9-month-old baby named Elsa. I love traveling with her and other kids, cooking, taking photos, singing, reading, playing guitar, and learning languages. I also love reading, watching movies, learning languages, watching travel shows, playing guitar, and thinking about the world and the world's problems.</p>
